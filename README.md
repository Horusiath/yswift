## Build instructions

Just opening the `.xcodeproj` and build :)

The project setup is heavily inspired by [Mozilla's example iOS app](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/tree/main/examples/app/ios).

There are few limitations at the moment, related to the packaging of fat framework for iOS. (E.g. you can't build for the simulator)
